## Overview
### Description
Dubb Club makes predictions for upcoming NBA games and displays the confidence of those predictions, along with other game and team statistics. It can be used to help with sports betting, or just by those who are fans of sports in general.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Sports
- **Mobile:** This app can be developed for computer or mobile. However, the mobile version requires differences in design to accommodate the smaller screen size and smartphone UX.
- **Story:**  Predicts outcomes of NBA games and presents results to users along with other game and team statistics.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, but the main focus is those who have an interest in the NBA or sports in general. 
- **Habit:** Usage of this app depends on just how interested a user is in the NBA or if they enjoy betting on sports games. It is also expected usage would decrease during the offseason.
- **Scope:** We are first starting with just NBA games, but there is room for growth in adding other major sporting leagues and potentially adding other social media features like forums or voting on probabilities.
